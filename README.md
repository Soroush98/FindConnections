# FindConnections

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Idea
FindConnections enables users to discover connections between notable individuals by identifying instances where they have been photographed together, either directly or through a short chain of others who share photos. This feature offers a unique perspective on the interconnectedness of public figures. Our platform is inspired by the concept of [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).

Here is how the famous comedy actor Steve Carell is connected to Travis Scott, a rapper. Steve Carell appeared in a picture with Timoth√©e Chalamet. Timoth√©e Chalamet appeared in a picture with Kylie Jenner, and finally, Kylie Jenner has a picture with Travis Scott. It's funny to see how people from different worlds can be connected with just a few connections!

### User Actions
1. **Unregistered Users**:
    - Anyone can enter two people's full names on the first page and click "Find Connections" to see their corresponding connection.
    - **Public Image Upload**: Unregistered users can upload images directly from the main page for analysis. Each IP address is limited to 10 uploads per day.

2. **Registered Users**:
    - **User Registration**: Users register on the platform by providing their basic information.
    - **User Profile**: After logging in, users can access their profile page where they can view and update their personal information.
    - **Photo Uploads**: Users can upload up to 10 pictures daily according to the upload guidelines. Each upload request will be reviewed by an admin, and if approved, new connections will be added to the website.

## Website

## Deployment

Deploy the FindConnections platform by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Soroush98/FindConnections.git
    cd FindConnections
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```env
    # AWS Configuration
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
    AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
    AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_main_bucket_name
    AWS_TEMP_BUCKET_NAME=your_temp_bucket_name
    
    # Security & Authentication
    SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
    VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
    
    # Database Configuration
    NEO4J_USER=your_neo4j_username
    NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
    
    # Email Configuration
    EMAIL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
    EMAIL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
    EMAIL_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_oauth_refresh_token
    
    # Analytics
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your_google_analytics_id
    ```

4. **Run the application**:

    Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

5. **Access the application**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Architecture

![alt text](Architecture.png)

The website (frontend and backend) is deployed on the Vercel platform. Vercel connects with a DynamoDB database for user and admin information and authentication. Vercel retrieves connections between two selected individuals from an EC2 instance running a Neo4j database. Each connection includes an image URL stored in this database. Based on this URL, Vercel fetches the images from an Amazon S3 instance to display to the user.

### Extended Architecture

![alt text](ExtendedArchitecture.png)

An additional Lambda-based pipeline has been integrated to allow admin users to automatically populate the dataset with new celebrity pair images. When an admin submits a webpage URL, an API Gateway forwards the request to a Lambda function that extracts image URLs and saves them. A second Lambda function is triggered via S3 to analyze the images using AWS Rekognition. If an image contains exactly two celebrities, it is saved back to the S3 bucket, expanding the dataset automatically.

## Security Features

FindConnections implements several security features to ensure the safety and privacy of its users:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Role-based access control to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.
    - The JWT is stored as an HTTP-only cookie to prevent client-side access and reduce the risk of XSS attacks.

2. **Data Encryption**:
    - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to ensure they are stored securely.

3. **Input Validation**:
    - Comprehensive input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

4. **Secure Communication**:
    - All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

5. **Secret Key Management**:
    - A secret key is used for signing JWT tokens and other cryptographic operations. This is kept secure and not hard-coded in the source code.

6. **Admin Page Security**:
    - The real admin page URL is not published in the source code to prevent unauthorized access. A fake admin page is used as a decoy to further enhance security.

7. **IP Lockouts**:
    - If an IP address attempts multiple failed logins within a short timeframe, it will be temporarily banned to prevent brute-force attacks.

8. **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced File Security & Antivirus Scanning**:
    - **VirusTotal Integration**: All uploaded files undergo mandatory antivirus scanning using the VirusTotal API before being stored.
    - **Magic Number Verification**: Files are checked for authentic image signatures to prevent disguised malicious files.

9. **üìä Rate Limiting & Upload Monitoring**:
    - **Daily Upload Limits**: Each IP address is limited to 10 uploads per day, tracked in DynamoDB.
    - **IP-based Tracking**: All uploads are logged with IP addresses and timestamps for monitoring and abuse prevention.
    - **Automatic Reset**: Upload limits reset daily at midnight to ensure fair usage.

## ÔøΩ Public Upload Feature

## ÔøΩüîÑ Automated Celebrity Pair Detection and Addition (Added by @Soroush-aali-bagi)

To enhance the dataset and streamline the process of adding new celebrity connections, an administrative feature has been introduced. This functionality allows administrators to input a URL pointing to a webpage containing celebrity images.‚Äã

Upon submission, the system performs the following steps:
1. **Image Extraction:** The system retrieves up to 50 images from the provided webpage.
2. **Celebrity Recognition:** Each image is analyzed using AWS Rekognition's RecognizeCelebrities API to detect and identify celebrities present in the images.
3. **Filtering Criteria:** Images that feature exactly two recognized celebrities are selected for inclusion.
4. **Storage:** The qualifying images are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, effectively expanding the dataset with new, relevant connections.

This automated approach reduces the need for manual data entry, ensuring a more efficient and scalable method for maintaining and growing the celebrity connections database.
